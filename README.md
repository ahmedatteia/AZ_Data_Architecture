> **Azure Data Architecture Learning Path | Hands-on Code & YouTube Tutorials**

This repository is a companion to my **YouTube series on Azure Data Architecture and Engineering**.  
Here, I'll walk through hands-on implementations of various **Azure data services**, using real-world scenarios and data projects.  
Each service includes code samples, architecture design, implementation steps, and integration examples.
